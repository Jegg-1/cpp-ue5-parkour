# 3D Parkour Game
### Made in Unreal Engine 5 (C++)

# Description
This is my first project in Unreal Engine 5. It's a simple parkour-style game where the goal is to complete an obstacle course as fast as possible. When the player reaches the end, they are returned to the main menu, which then displays the time it took to complete the course.

The project focuses on basic gameplay mechanics and a simple UI system. I aimed to implement as much of the functionality as possible in C++ since this was a university project for a C++ course.
